app.py

requirements.txt

Procfile

-templates/

index.html

static/

-styles.css

script.js

app.py: The main Flask application file, handling routes and rendering templates.

requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies for the project.

Procfile: Specifies the command to run the application on platforms like Render.

templates/: Contains HTML template files (e.g., index.html).
static/: Contains static assets like CSS (styles.css) and JavaScript (script.js).

Technologies Used

Flask: Python web framework.

HTML5: Structure of the web pages.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

JavaScript: Client-side logic for interactive features and data persistence (using Local Storage).

Gunicorn: WSGI HTTP Server for production deployment.

2. git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

3. cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME

4. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

5. python-m venv venv

6. Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

7. Install the dependencies:

8. pip install -r requirements.txt

9. Run the Flask application:

10. python app.py
The application will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your web browser.

Deployment on Render

This application is configured for easy deployment on Render.com.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.

2. Create a new Web Service on Render.

3. Connect your GitHub repository.

4. Configure the build and start commands:

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: gunicorn app:app

5. Deploy! Render will automatically detect your Procfile and requirements.txt to build and run your application.

Usage

Navigate between "Add Item", "Inventory & Valuation", and "Stock Modification" screens using the navigation buttons.

On the "Add Item" screen, fill in the details and click "Add Item" to add new inventory.

On the "Inventory & Valuation" screen, you can view your current stock and search for items.

On the "Stock Modification" screen, select an item, enter the quantity to change, choose the reason (Sale or Damage), and apply the change. If it's a sale, specify the sale price.

10. Conclusion

                 The Smart Register Flask App provides a functional and intuitive solution for basic inventory and financial tracking. By leveraging modern web technologies and simple data persistence, it offers a quick and easy way for users to manage their stock. Its modular design and clear separation of concerns (Flask for backend, dedicated files for HTML, CSS, and JS) make it maintainable and extensible. While currently relying on client-side storage, the architecture allows for straightforward future enhancements to integrate a database and expand its capabilities for more advanced business needs. This project serves as a solid foundation for a comprehensive inventory management system.
